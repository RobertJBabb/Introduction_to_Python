Introduction to Python using: Adafruit CircuitPython & Circuit Playground Express

This workshop is designed to be a fun introduction to the Python language and micro-controllers. 

This is a hands on interactive workshop!

Over 3 hours we will explore programming concepts with Python while we implement a project to translate sound into a colorful light display. This is a beginner class, no prior programming experience is needed.

We will cover:
 * How to install CircuitPython on the Circuit Playground Express
 * Installing the Mu Python editor 
 * Basic Python concepts, syntax, data types, operators, and expressions
 * How to use Python to interact with the Circuit Playground Express 

At the completion of the class you will have your own Circuit Playground Express to take home, programmed in Python to create a colorful light display in response to sound. You will be on your way to creating your own interactive projects!
